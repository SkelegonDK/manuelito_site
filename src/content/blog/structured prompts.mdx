# The Power of Structured Prompts

A new wave of AI image generators is here, boasting impressive understanding and fewer artifacts. This is great, but let's be honest: balancing the detail you *can* provide with the detail the AI *needs* for predictable results remains a challenge. You want consistency, not a lottery.

## Your Prompt's Blueprint
What's the solution? **Structured input.** This isn't complex; it's just data. \
Think **JSON**, **YAML**, **XML**, or even **Markdown**. By using data structures, you give your prompts a clear, unambiguous context, leading directly to more predictable and consistent image generation. \ \
This is about taking control of the chaos. Instead of vague prose, you're providing a precise blueprint.
Consider this OpenAI Image-1 prompt example for a logo in a specific 3D material:

> Generate an image of this logo based on this 3D material on a transparent background:
```json
{
  "style": "Hyper-realistic 3D Render",
  "material": "frosted transparent crystal",
  "color_palette": ["soft white", "rainbow light spectrum", "holographic highlights"],
  "background": "Transparent alpha channel",
  "object_properties": {
    "finish": "smooth matte with glossy edges",
    "lighting": "strong directional spotlight from multiple angles to create prism effects",
    "transparency": "70%",
    "surface_details": "sharp cuts and beveled edges with internal light scattering"
  },
  "shapes": ["mechanical nut", "technical forms", "geometric objects"],
  "camera_angle": "macro close-up, slightly tilted for dramatic depth",
  "resolution": "ultra-high, 8K preferred",
  "shadows": "soft and colorful diffusion",
  "details": {
    "reflections": true,
    "refraction": true,
    "prismatic dispersion": true,
    "subsurface scattering": true
  }
}
```

## Here's the template:
> Generate an image of my logo based on this 3D material on a transparent background:

```json
{
  "style": "$STYLE$",
  "material": "$MATERIAL$",
  "color_palette": ["$COLOR_1$", "$COLOR_2$", "$COLOR_3$"],
  "background": "$BACKGROUND_DESCRIPTION$",
  "object_properties": {
    "finish": "$FINISH$",
    "lighting": "$LIGHTING_DESCRIPTION$",
    "transparency": "$TRANSPARENCY_PERCENTAGE$",
    "surface_details": "$SURFACE_DETAILS$"
  },
  "shapes": ["$SHAPE_1$", "$SHAPE_2$", "$SHAPE_3$"],
  "camera_angle": "$CAMERA_ANGLE$",
  "resolution": "$RESOLUTION$",
  "shadows": "$SHADOWS_DESCRIPTION$",
  "details": {
    "reflections": "$REFLECTIONS_BOOLEAN$",
    "refraction": "$REFRACTION_BOOLEAN$",
    "prismatic dispersion": "$PRISMATIC_DISPERSION_BOOLEAN$",
    "subsurface scattering": "$SUBSURFACE_SCATTERING_BOOLEAN$"
  }
}
```

## The Template for Consistency
This approach isn't just for one-off use. It's a template. You can fill in the values yourself if you have a clear vision, or, even better, describe the material to an LLM and have *it* populate the data structure. This is how you scale consistency.

## For storytelling:
> Generate a high-detail image depicting the following scene, based on a cinematic script breakdown:

```json
{
  "scene_overview": "Theodore shares an intimate, playful \"date\" with Samantha on a serene beach. It captures their unique, surreal connection amidst natural beauty.",
  "location": "A vast, uncrowded beach with soft, warm sand leading to a calm ocean. The distant horizon is hazy, blurring sea and sky into an expansive, ethereal backdrop.",
  "time_of_day_lighting": "Late afternoon, transitioning into the golden hour. Lighting is soft, diffused, and incredibly warm, casting long, gentle shadows.",
  "mood_atmosphere": "Intimate, contemplative, and subtly melancholic, yet quietly joyful. A pervasive sense of peaceful isolation and fragile beauty.",
  "primary_characters": [
    "Theodore Twombly: Mid-30s, relaxed attire, listening intently with an earpiece.",
    "His expression shifts between introspection and subtle smiles, conveying deep absorption."
  ],
  "secondary_characters_elements": [
    "Few or no other figures, emphasizing Theodore's solitary focus.",
    "Gentle, rhythmic ocean waves provide a calming backdrop."
  ],
  "additional_visual_directives_style_notes": [
    "Soft, shallow depth of field with a dreamlike quality; warm, muted color palette.",
    "Emphasize light wrapping around Theodore; focus on his subtle expressions."
  ]
}
```

## Lastly

**PRO TIP 1:** Want a PNG with a transparent background? Explicitly set `"background"` to `"Transparent alpha channel"`. Don't leave it to chance.

**PRO TIP 2:** If you're compositing, make sure the `"camera_angle"` in your prompt matches that of the photo or object you're applying the material to. Details matter for seamless integration.

Ultimately, using structured data gives you a powerful lever over AI image generation. It shifts you from guessing to defining, from hoping to achieving predictable results. That's the real win.
