Discover the fundamentals of AI-assisted coding with Cursor. This hands-on course introduces you to the world of AI coding through practical exercises that demystify the technology and give you confidence to start building with AI assistance.

Learn the essential skills, mindset, and "vibes" that make AI coding feel natural and productive. No prior AI experience required - just curiosity and willingness to experiment.

## What You'll Learn

- **Cursor Fundamentals**: Understand what Cursor is, how it works, and why it's transforming how we build software.
- **Your First Rules**: Create simple but powerful rules that immediately improve your coding workflow.
- **AI Communication**: Learn how to "talk" to AI effectively - the art of prompting and context.
- **The Coding Vibes**: Develop the mindset and workflow that makes AI coding feel natural and productive.
- **Practical Patterns**: Walk away with working examples you can immediately use and build upon.

## Course Highlights

My approach focuses on **learning by doing** rather than overwhelming theory.

You'll experience:

- Setting up Cursor from scratch (we'll do this together).
- Creating your first rule that actually works and saves you time.
- Understanding the "conversation" between you and AI.
- Building confidence through hands-on practice with immediate feedback.
- Developing intuition for when and how to use AI assistance effectively.

## What We'll Build Together

**Hands-On Projects:**
- Your first custom rule for your preferred language or framework
- A simple but effective code review helper
- Basic documentation automation
- Personal coding shortcuts that match your style
- Templates for common tasks you do regularly

**Essential Skills:**
- How to write effective prompts that get the results you want
- Understanding AI responses and iterating effectively
- Building rules that grow with your needs
- Troubleshooting when things don't work as expected

## Why Start Here

Unlike advanced AI courses that assume expertise, this program meets you where you are. You'll build practical skills through guided experimentation, developing both technical knowledge and the intuitive "feel" for AI-assisted coding.

The course emphasizes learning through curiosity and play - the same spirit that makes the best developers. You'll leave not just with working code, but with the confidence to continue exploring and expanding your AI coding skills.
