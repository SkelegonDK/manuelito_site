Using vision models, language models and image generation models, I've created a workflow that consistently creates clean and professional previews of window replacement projects.

It takes cleans up the image, removing any distractions from the image. Then using special prompts and language models, it generates a prompt for the image model to use. This can be anything from styles, materials, accessories and particular colors.
