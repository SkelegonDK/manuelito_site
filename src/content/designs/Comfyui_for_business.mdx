![Coffee Hug Logo](@/assets/coffehug_logo.png)
Based my new logo and rebrand on an old sketch. A flaming hot cop of coffee. Warm and conforting, but also full of energy and drive.

Now I can use it as reference for any image generation. Wether it's for useful icons and graphics or for fun and playful illustrations for my articles.
