Using a JSON formatted prompt, can be a game changer in achieving very specific results. Some times even better than using a 3D model. 

Ask anyone to render specific materials can be very taxing, in modern laptops. Here you can have a prompt with all the necessary values and variable a real 3D model would have. But now we will use image generation to simulate the material based on this logo.

Saving me 3 whole steps. Modeling, adding materials and and lighting. Still renders, but much faster. This can be applied as a creative tool for graphic design, but also for products and material exploration.


**Prompt:** <br/>
"Generate an image of my logo based on this 3D material on a transparent background:"

```json
{
  "style": "Hyper-realistic 3D Render",
  "material": "frosted transparent crystal",
  "color_palette": ["soft white", "rainbow light spectrum", "holographic highlights"],
  "background": "Transparent alpha channel",
  "object_properties": {
    "finish": "smooth matte with glossy edges",
    "lighting": "strong directional spotlight from multiple angles to create prism effects",
    "transparency": "70%",
    "surface_details": "sharp cuts and beveled edges with internal light scattering"
  },
  "shapes": ["mechanical nut", "technical forms", "geometric objects"],
  "camera_angle": "macro close-up, slightly tilted for dramatic depth",
  "resolution": "ultra-high, 8K preferred",
  "shadows": "soft and colorful diffusion",
  "details": {
    "reflections": true,
    "refraction": true,
    "prismatic dispersion": true,
    "subsurface scattering": true
  }
}
