Using Synthesias powerful AI video creation tool, we can add any context, ranging from web articles to product descriptions and PDFs.

This allows us to create a video that is tailored to the specific product or service, a specific audience or a specific message.

Videos in Synthesia Studio can be concurrently translated to multiple languages, and can be used in a variety of channels, including social media, email, and websites.

In this case I took a simple article for a sales ad for an apartment, used a few prompts to add context and then let Synthesia Studio create a video. I only added a logo, some colors and changed a few images.
